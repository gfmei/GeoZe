## News
* We release the code for zero-shot 3D part segmentation ðŸ”¥.


## Introduction
We introduce the first training-free aggregation technique that leverages the point cloudâ€™s 3D geometric structure to improve 
the quality of the transferred VLM representations.

Our approach first clusters point cloud ${\mathcal{P}}$ into superpoints $\bar{{\mathcal{P}}}$ along with their 
associated geometric representation $\bar{{\mathcal{G}}}$, VLM representation $\bar{{\mathcal{F}}}$, and anchors ${{\mathcal{C}}}$. 
For each superpoint $\bar{{p}_j}$, we identify its $knn$ within the point cloud to form a patch ${\mathcal{P}}^j$ with their features ${\mathcal{G}}^j$ and ${\mathcal{F}}^j$.
For each patch, we perform a local feature aggregation to refine the VLM representations ${{\mathcal{F}}}$.
The superpoints then undergo a process of global aggregation. 
A global-to-local aggregation process is applied to update the per-point features.
Lastly, we employ the VLM feature anchors to further refine per-point features, which are then ready to be utilized for 
downstream tasks.

## Usage

### Installation
Prepare environment for part segmentation

'''bash

conda install pytorch==2.1.2 torchvision==0.16.2 torchaudio==2.1.2 pytorch-cuda=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia

'''

### Evaluation
 Part segmentation on ShapeNet

'''bash
python part_run.py --datasetpath Your shapenet data path
'''
