## Introduction
We introduce the first training-free aggregation technique that leverages the point cloudâ€™s 3D geometric structure to improve 
the quality of the transferred VLM representations.

Our approach first clusters point cloud $\bm{\mathcal{P}}$ into superpoints $\bar{\bm{\mathcal{P}}}$ along with their 
associated geometric representation $\bar{\bm{\mathcal{G}}}$, VLM representation $\bar{\bm{\mathcal{F}}}$, and anchors ${\bm{\mathcal{C}}}$. 
For each superpoint $\bar{\bm{p}_j}$, we identify its $knn$ within the point cloud to form a patch $\bm{\mathcal{P}}^j$ with their features $\bm{\mathcal{G}}^j$ and $\bm{\mathcal{F}}^j$.
For each patch, we perform a local feature aggregation to refine the \vlmfeats ${\bm{\mathcal{F}}}$.
The superpoints then undergo a process of global aggregation. 
A global-to-local aggregation process is applied to update the per-point features.
Lastly, we employ the VLM feature anchors to further refine per-point features, which are then ready to be utilized for 
downstream tasks.
